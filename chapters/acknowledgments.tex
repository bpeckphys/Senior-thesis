This thesis would not have been possible without the support of Dr. Donna Calhoun and Scott Aiton who have answered my seemingly innumerous questions with grace. I am especially indebted to my adviser Dr. Grady Wright who has been incredibly supportive of my research and who has constantly given advice and direction in both my academics as-well-as my career goals.

I am grateful to everyone with whom I have have had the pleasure of working with while researching and writing this thesis. Each professor that I have interacted with in the math department at Boise State University has provided me with extensive personal and professional guidance as I finish my degree and begin life as both a graduate and first-time father.

During my time as a student, no one has been more important to me than my family. I would like to thank my parents for their constant love, support, and understanding. Most importantly, I wish to thank my wife, Teri, for her unending love and support and for understanding the amount of time that goes into doing research and completing a degree.
